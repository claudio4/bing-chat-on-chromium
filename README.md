# Bing Chat on Chromium
Bing Chat on Chromium is a Chrome extension that allows you to use Bing chat in any Chromium-based browser, such as Google Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, and others. With this extension, you can access Bing Chat on your preferred browser without having to switch to Microsoft Edge.

## Why Use Bing Chat on Chromium? 🤔💡
Microsoft has imposed an artificial dependency on Edge for Bing Chat, meaning that users must use Edge to access the chat platform. This can be frustrating for users who prefer other Chromium-based browsers. Bing Chat on Chromium bypasses this limitation by using request header spoofing to make Bing think that the user is accessing the chat platform from Edge, even when they are using a different browser.

## Features 🎉
* Allows access to Bing Chat on any Chromium-based browser.
* Uses request header spoofing to make Bing think the user is accessing the chat platform from Edge.
* No extra data collection.
* More performant and Manifest V3 ready with declarativeNetRequest API.
